## ⚠️ Note  
> While copying and pasting may seem convenient, **typing the code yourself** is crucial for learning.  
We recommend you:

- Read and understand each task carefully  
- Write the code manually to internalize logic  
- Experiment and test different behaviors  
- Reflect on the differences between state management techniques

🧠 **Hands-on practice leads to deeper learning. Keep coding!**
